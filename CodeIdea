We will have multiple tasks that you have to complete until the user fails.

We will start with 1 task (push a button, X or something)
Then every minute we will add a new task that you have to complete.

So there will be rounds, where you need to finish all of the tasks within 1min.
Once you finish all the tasks within that minute then you will have completed that round and then a 10 sec timmer will start to the next round
